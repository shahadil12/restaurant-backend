Backend API (NestJS)  This repository contains the backend service for a role-based food ordering application built using NestJS and TypeScript. The system supports restaurant browsing, menu management, order creation, checkout, payment handling, and order cancellation with strict role-based access control (RBAC) and region-based data isolation.
